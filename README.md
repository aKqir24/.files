Finally I am satisfied, the story of this rice is when I got tired of trying so many linux distros. I did enjoy ricing some of them like Arch, Artix, Ubuntu, & Linux Mint ( My First Distro ), but nowadays time is not in my hand and I have grown trying fix many errors I encounter with these distros. So to ease the pain from this torture, I went searching for the most stable linux distro I could find, and it is debian, where I can finally say I am home:D
